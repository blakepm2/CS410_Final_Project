## Objective

Create a Google Chrome extension that acts as a [Knowledge Graph Builder](https://www.ibm.com/topics/knowledge-graph#:~:text=A%20knowledge%20graph%2C%20also%20known,the%20term%20knowledge%20%E2%80%9Cgraph.%E2%80%9D) for webpages that the user visits while researching information online; 
the extension should represent the user's visited webpages as nodes in a graph where the edges reflect the relative similarity between them such that similar webpages will be clustered together. 
This will offer user's an intuitive way to visualize their search history while performing online research and eliminate the reliance on other third party applications to track this information.
